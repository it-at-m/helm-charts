# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

Contributions are welcome via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

**Issue/Pull request template**

Isssues or Pull requests to a chart should be created with prefix `[charts/<name>]` eg: `[charts/ezldap]`

**Bumping chart version**

Every PR should include chart version bump, because we can not have different version of the charts with the same version name.

_If not, the CI lint will fail and PR can't be accepted_
