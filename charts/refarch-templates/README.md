# refarch

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a sample RefArch deployment based on the architecture described in [RefArch documentation](https://refarch.oss.muenchen.de/overview.html) on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.
It acts as an example and dependency to create Helm charts for deploying applications based on the RefArch and [its templates](https://refarch.oss.muenchen.de/templates/).
It consists of the following components:
- [refarch-backend](https://github.com/it-at-m/refarch-templates/tree/main/refarch-backend)
- [refarch-eai](https://github.com/it-at-m/refarch-templates/tree/main/refarch-eai)
- [refarch-frontend](https://github.com/it-at-m/refarch-templates/tree/main/refarch-frontend)
- [refarch-webcomponent](https://github.com/it-at-m/refarch-templates/tree/main/refarch-webcomponent)

> **Note:** This chart does not ship with an [API Gateway](https://refarch.oss.muenchen.de/gateway.html).
If you need an API Gateway define it as an additional chart dependency. The respective chart can be found [here](https://github.com/it-at-m/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/refarch-gateway)

## Installing the Chart

Install this chart using:

```bash
helm install my-refarch-release it-at-m/refarch --values my-values.yaml
```

The file `values-example.yaml` contains a minimal example (includes no running component). The [Configuration](#configuration) section lists all the parameters that can be configured via `values.yaml`.

## Configuration

This chart was built to be reused by applications using the reference architecture of it@M.
When defining your own `values.yaml` files, all configuration options explained below need to be done under the `refarch-templats` key.
Example:
```yaml
refarch-templates:
  # global configuration
  # ....
  # module-specific configuration
  # ....
```

If you also need an API Gateway, add its Helm chart to your Chart dependencies.
Configuration of the Gateway must then be placed under the `refarch-gateway` key.
See further information [here](https://github.com/it-at-m/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/refarch-gateway).
Example:
```yaml
refarch-gateway:
  # gateway configuration options
```

The configuration for the templates split into global configuration options (which are to be reused by all defined modules), and module specific options that only apply to one RefArch component.
It should be noted that the global or module specific configuration do not change the visibility and are only separated for a better visibility.
`module` is a concept introduced in this chart to be able to define all required deployments as a list and keep the downstream charts as a dependency as lean as possible.

> **Note:** All code snippets included in this `README` are complete in itself. This allows to easily copy and paste configuration snippets into your own `values.yml`.

### Global configurations

Those configurations create Kubernetes resources which are not specifically bound to a module.

#### Secrets

Global Secrets can be created using this Helm chart. Note that the keys for the Secret can be created, but the values need to be filled in manually using GUI or CLI mechanisms.

> **Note:** The secret will only be created once and will not be overridden. It is not possible to change the structure after creating a secret with this helm-chart, except the corresponding secret was deleted. Furthermore, this resource will not be deleted by uninstalling the chart.

Example:
```yaml
  secrets:
    - name: my-secret
      keys:
        - mykey1
        - mykey2
        - mykey3
```

#### ConfigMaps

Global ConfigMaps can be configured to reuse them across multiple modules. You can store property-like keys and file-like keys in it.

> **Note:** In contrast to the secret, the configmap is intended to be fulÂ´ly managed by this helm-chart. Any changes will be reflected in the created ressource.

Example:
```yaml
  configMaps:
    - name: my-configmap
      data:
        # property-like keys; each key maps to a simple value
        player_initial_lives: "3"
        # file-like keys
        myfile.txt: |
          enemy.types=aliens,monsters
          player.maximum-lives=5
```

#### ImagePull Secrets

Image pull Secrets might be necessary to bypass pull limits by certain container registries or access private registries.
The image pull Secrets are reused for all modules you define.

Example:
```yaml
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: my-pull-secret
```

### Module configurations

Modules consist of individual components in an array.
Each module consist of individuell Kubernetes resources (e.g. Deployment, Service, HPA, ...).
All configuration options need to be inside a `module`.

Example:
```yaml
  modules:
    # add your modules configuration here (as a list)
```

#### Base information

Base information involves setting the module name and the docker image (and tag) to use.
Additionally, you can override the `pullPolicy`, which is set to `IfNotPresent` by default.

Example:
```yaml
    - name: frontend
      image:
        repository: ghcr.io/it-at-m/refarch-templates/refarch-frontend
        pullPolicy: Always # Defaults to IfNotPresent
        tag: "latest"
```

#### Resources & Scaling

You can define your resources like CPU and RAM and the desired replicas as stated below. If you don't set those properties, those values will be used by default:
```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 512Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 512Mi
    replicas: 1
```

> **Note:** You can also just override the `requests` or `limits`, but always need to set `cpu` and `memory` if you do so.

Configuring auto-scaling is optional and disabled by default (enabled by configuring the `autoscalling` block).
Example:
```yaml
    autoscaling:
      minReplicas: 1 # defaults to 1
      maxReplicas: 10
      targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80 # optional
      targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80 # optional
```

#### Configuration management

This chart provides multiple ways to set configuration for your deployments.

If you have a Spring-based application you can directly configure the content of the application.yml file.
The content will be placed inside a module-specific ConfigMap which is mounted into the container at runtime.
You can define environment variables in it as well.

Example:
```yaml
    applicationYML:
      MY_ENV_VARIABLE: someValue
      spring:
        profiles:
          active: "myprofile"
```

Alternatively you can define single environment variables as follows, optionally referencing an entry inside a global Secret or ConfigMap.
This can e.g. be used to set `JAVA_OPTS_APPEND`.

Example:
```yaml
    env:
      # static
      - name: MY_ENV_VARIABLE
        value: myvalue
      # reference to Secret
      - name: MY_ENV_FROM_SECRET
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: my-global-secret
            key: my-key
      # reference to ConfigMap
      - name: MY_ENV_FROM_CONFIGMAP
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: my-global-configmap
            key: my-key
```

If you need to set multiple environment variables at once, you can load the whole content of a global Secret or ConfigMap.
In this case, the name of the keys in the Secret or ConfigMap define the name of the created environment variable.

Example:
```yaml
    envFrom:
      # whole files of envs
      - configMapRef:
          name: my-global-configmap
      - secretRef:
          name: my-global-secret
```

#### Networking

To expose your deployments (either cluster-interally or externally) services and ingresses can be used.

For services, you can either define all port mappings manually or use the custom defined properties, which configure mappings that are required by most services.
Setting `http` to `true`, will result in the following port-mapping to be added:
```yaml
      - name: http
        protocol: TCP
        port: 8080
        targetPort: http
```

Example for configuring a service:
```yaml
    service:
      http: true
      ports:
        - name: custom-port
          protocol: TCP
          port: 1234
          targetPort: 5678
```

Ingress is required if you want to expose the deployment externally.
Example:
```yaml
    ingress:
      port: 1234    # defaults to 8080
      className: "" # optional
      annotations: # optional custom annotations
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
      hosts:
        - host: my-example.local
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: ImplementationSpecific
      tls:
        - secretName: my-tls-secret
          hosts:
            - my-example.local
```

#### Storage

By default, no volumes are defined and no mounts are mounted connected to the containers. This can be useful to attach files like certificates.
Example:
```yaml
    volumes:
      - name: cacerts-lhm
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          secretName: cacerts-lhm
          items:
            - key: cacerts-lhm
              path: cacerts
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java
        name: cacerts-lhm
        readOnly: true
```

#### Monitoring

Health checks are required to validate the functionality of the running deployments.
You can override `startupProbe`, `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` individually.

The following configuration is picked up by default:
```yaml
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /actuator/health
        port: http
        initialDelaySeconds: 60
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /actuator/health/liveness
        port: http
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /actuator/health/readiness
        port: http
```

> **Note:**: Those defaults are suitable for Spring-based applications, because applications like `refarch-backend` or `refarch-eai` expose those endpoints via Spring Actuator.
Web components like `refarch-frontend` or `refarch-webcomponent` are compatible as well, as those mimic the actuator API.
